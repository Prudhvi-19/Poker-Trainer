## Cline rules for this repo (Poker-Trainer)

These rules capture **behavior and requirements** that may evolve during the engagement.

### Workflow

- Always create/use a feature branch for changes (do not commit to `main`).
- Prefer small, reviewable commits; keep commit messages descriptive.
- When doing a refactor, first document issues in `openBugs.md`, then fix.

### Bug tracking

- Keep `openBugs.md` up-to-date with:
  - severity (P0–P3),
  - repro steps,
  - suspected root cause,
  - fix idea,
  - status.
- When a bug is fixed, move it to `closedBugs.md` with:
  - date,
  - PR/commit reference,
  - short verification notes.

### Engineering quality targets

- Favor correctness and determinism in trainers (avoid random/ambiguous “correct answers”).
- Avoid DOM lookups by id when element references already exist (store refs).
- Avoid duplicate sources of truth (share logic via `js/utils/*` where possible).
- Harden localStorage reads/writes; always merge stored settings with `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`.

### Product / design targets

- Upgrade UI to “production-grade” polish (Apple/Google-level):
  - consistent spacing, typography scale, and component states,
  - accessible contrast and focus states,
  - smooth animations that respect `prefers-reduced-motion`,
  - responsive behavior across mobile/desktop.
